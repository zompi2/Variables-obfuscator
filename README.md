In-memory variables obfuscator
=====
This little header library can obfuscate a variable in a memory in a very simple way.  

You can read more about it in the blog entry: https://zompidev.blogspot.com/2015/03/simple-protection-against-memory-hacking.html

There is also an improved version of this bofuscator inside my plugin for Unreal Engine 4: https://github.com/zompi2/Static-Variables-Obfuscator-UE4
